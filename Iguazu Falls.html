      Straddling the border between Brazil and Argentina, Iguazu Falls are the
      world's largest system of waterfalls. While a majority of the falls are
      located within Argentina, you'll get the best views from the Brazilian
      side.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      Iguazú Falls or Iguaçu Falls are waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the
      border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian state of
      Paraná. Together, they make up the largest waterfall system in the world.
      The falls divide the river into the upper and lower Iguazu. The Iguazu
      River rises near the heart of the city of Curitiba. For most of its
      course, the river flows through Brazil; however, most of the falls are on
      the Argentine side. Below its confluence with the San Antonio River, the
      Iguazu River forms the border between Argentina and Brazil.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      The name Iguazú comes from the Guarani or Tupi words "y", meaning "water",
      and "ûasú", meaning "big". Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a
      beautiful woman named Naipí, who fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a
      canoe. In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the waterfalls and
      condemning the lovers to an eternal fall. The first European to record the
      existence of the falls was the Spanish Conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
      Vaca in 1541.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="title Igu"><u>Geology and geography</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      The staircase character of the falls consists of a two-step waterfall
      formed by three layers of basalt. The steps are 35 and 40 metres (115 and
      131 ft) in height. The columnar basalt rock sequences are part of the
      1,000-metre-thick (3,300 ft) Serra Geral formation within the
      Paleozoic-Mesozoic Paraná Basin. The tops of these sequences are
      characterized by 8 to 10 m (26 to 33 ft) of highly resistant vesicular
      basalt and the contact between these layers controls the shape of the
      falls. Headwater erosion rates are estimated at 1.4 to 2.1 cm/year (0.55
      to 0.83 in/year). Numerous islands along the 2.7-kilometre-long (1.7 mi)
      edge divide the falls into many separate waterfalls and cataracts, varying
      between 60 and 82 m (197 and 269 ft) high. The number of these smaller
      waterfalls fluctuates from 150 to 300, depending on the water level. About
      half of the river's flow falls into a long and narrow chasm called the
      Devil's Throat (Garganta del Diablo in Spanish or Garganta do Diabo in
      Portuguese).
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      The Devil's Throat canyon is 80 to 90 m (260 to 300 ft) wide and 70 to 80
      m (230 to 260 ft) deep. Left of this canyon, another part of the river
      forms 160 to 200 individual falls, which merge into a single front during
      the flood stage. The largest falls are named San Martín, Adam and Eva,
      Penoni, and Bergano.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      About 900 m (2,950 ft) of the 2.7 km (1.7 mi) length does not have water
      flowing over it. The water of the lower Iguazu collects in a canyon that
      drains into the Paraná River, a short distance downstream from the Itaipu
      Dam. The junction of the water flows marks the border between Brazil,
      Argentina, and Paraguay. Some points in the cities of Foz do Iguaçu,
      Brazil, Puerto Iguazú, Argentina, and Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, have
      access to the Iguazu River, where the borders of all three nations may be
      seen, a popular tourist attraction for visitors to the three cities.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      The Iguazu Falls are arranged in a way that resembles a reversed letter
      "J". The Argentina Brazil border runs through the Devil's Throat. On the
      right bank is the Brazilian territory, which is home to more than 95% of
      the Iguazu River basin but has just over 20% of the jumps of these falls,
      and the left side jumps are Argentine, which make up almost 80% of the
      falls.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="title Igu"><u>Climate</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Igu">
      The Iguazu Falls experience a humid subtropical climate (Cfa, according to
      the Köppen climate classification) with abundant precipitation and high
      temperatures year-round. During the summer of 2006, a severe drought
      caused the Iguazu River to become diminished, reducing the amount of water
      flowing over the falls to 300 cubic metres per second (11,000 cu ft/s)
      until early December. This was unusual, as dry periods normally last only
      a few weeks.[17] The period with the greatest volume of water flowing over
      the falls is usually December to February, coinciding with one of the
      periods of greatest rainfall.
