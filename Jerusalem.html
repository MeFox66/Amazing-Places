      Throughout its long history, Jerusalem has been destroyed at least twice,
      besieged 23 times, captured and recaptured 44 times, and attacked 52
      times. The part of Jerusalem called the City of David shows first signs of
      settlement in the 4th millennium BCE, in the shape of encampments of
      nomadic shepherds. During the Canaanite period (14th century BCE),
      Jerusalem was named as Urusalim on ancient Egyptian tablets, probably
      meaning "City of Shalem" after a Canaanite deity. During the Israelite
      period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 10th
      century BCE (Iron Age II), and by the 9th century BCE, the city had
      developed into the religious and administrative centre of the Kingdom of
      Judah. In 1538, the city walls were rebuilt for a last time around
      Jerusalem under Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. Today
      those walls define the Old City, which since the 19th century has been
      divided into four quarters the Armenian, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim
      quarters. The Old City became a World Heritage Site in 1981, and is on the
      List of World Heritage in Danger. Since 1860, Jerusalem has grown far
      beyond the Old City's boundaries. In 2022, Jerusalem had a population of
      some 971,800 residents, of which almost 60% were Jews and almost 40%
      Palestinians. In 2020, the population was 951,100, of which Jews comprised
      570,100 (59.9%), Muslims 353,800 (37.2%), Christians 16,300 (1.7%), and
      10,800 unclassified (1.1%).
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      According to the Hebrew Bible, King David conquered the city from the
      Jebusites and established it as the capital of the United Kingdom of
      Israel, and his son, King Solomon, commissioned the building of the First
      Temple. Modern scholars argue that Jews branched out of the Canaanite
      peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatrous—and
      later monotheistic—religion centred on El/Yahweh. These foundational
      events, straddling the dawn of the 1st millennium BCE, assumed central
      symbolic importance for the Jewish people. The sobriquet of holy city
      (Hebrew: עיר הקודש, romanized: 'Ir ha-Qodesh) was probably attached to
      Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The holiness of Jerusalem in Christianity,
      conserved in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, which Christians
      adopted as the Old Testament, was reinforced by the New Testament account
      of Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection there. Meanwhile, in Sunni Islam,
      Jerusalem is the third-holiest city, after Mecca and Medina. The city was
      the first standard direction for Muslim prayers, and in Islamic tradition,
      Muhammad made his Night Journey there in 621, ascending to heaven where he
      speaks to God, per the Quran. As a result, despite having an area of only
      0.9 km2 (3/8 sq mi), the Old City is home to many sites of seminal
      religious importance, among them the Temple Mount with its Western Wall,
      Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      At present, the status of Jerusalem remains one of the core issues in the
      Israeli Palestinian conflict. During the 1948 Arab Israeli War, West
      Jerusalem was among the areas incorporated into Israel, while East
      Jerusalem, including the Old City, was occupied and annexed by Jordan.
      Israel occupied East Jerusalem from Jordan during the 1967 Six-Day War and
      subsequently annexed it into the city's municipality, together with
      additional surrounding territory.[note 6] One of Israel's Basic Laws, the
      1980 Jerusalem Law, refers to Jerusalem as the country's undivided
      capital. All branches of the Israeli government are located in Jerusalem,
      including the Knesset (Israel's parliament), the residences of the Prime
      Minister and President, and the Supreme Court. The international community
      rejects the annexation as illegal and regards East Jerusalem as
      Palestinian territory occupied by Israel.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="title Je"><u>History</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      Given the city's central position in both Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and
      Palestinian nationalism, the selectivity required to summarize some 5,000
      years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or
      background. Israeli or Jewish nationalists claim a right to the city based
      on Jewish indigeneity to the land, particularly their origins in and
      descent from the Israelites, for whom Jerusalem is their capital, and
      their yearning for return. In contrast, Palestinian nationalists claim the
      right to the city based on modern Palestinians' longstanding presence and
      descent from many different peoples who have settled or lived in the
      region over the centuries. Another reason for their claim, which is also
      supported by the Arab and Muslim world, is significance of Jerusalem in
      Islam. Both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by
      the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city, and
      that this is borne out by the different focuses the different writers
      place on the various events and eras in the city's history.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      The earliest evidence of city fortifications appear in the Mid- to Late
      Bronze Age and could date to around the 18th century BCE. By around 1550
      to1200 BCE, Jerusalem was the capital of an Egyptian vassal city-state, a
      modest settlement governing a few outlying villages and pastoral areas,
      with a small Egyptian garrison and ruled by appointees such as king
      Abdi-Heba. At the time of Seti I (r. 1290 to1279 BCE) and Ramesses II (r.
      1279 to1213 BCE), major construction took place as prosperity increased.
      The city's inhabitants at this time were Canaanites, who are believed by
      scholars to have evolved into the Israelites via the development of a
      distinct Yahweh-centric monotheistic belief system.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      Archaeological remains from the ancient Israelite period include the
      Siloam Tunnel, an aqueduct built by Judahite king Hezekiah and once
      containing an ancient Hebrew inscription, known as the Siloam inscription;
      the so-called Broad Wall, a defensive fortification built in the 8th
      century BCE, also by Hezekiah; the Silwan necropolis (9th to 7th c. BCE)
      with the Monolith of Silwan and the Tomb of the Royal Steward, which were
      decorated with monumental Hebrew inscriptions; and the so-called Israelite
      Tower, remnants of ancient fortifications, built from large, sturdy rocks
      with carved cornerstones. A huge water reservoir dating from this period
      was discovered in 2012 near Robinson's Arch, indicating the existence of a
      densely built-up quarter across the area west of the Temple Mount during
      the Kingdom of Judah.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      When the Assyrians conquered the Kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE, Jerusalem
      was strengthened by a great influx of refugees from the northern kingdom.
      When Hezekiah ruled, Jerusalem had no fewer than 25,000 inhabitants and
      covered 25 acres (10 hectares).
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      In 587 to 586 BCE, Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire
      conquered Jerusalem after a prolonged siege, and then systematically
      destroyed the city, including Solomon's Temple. The Kingdom of Judah was
      abolished and many were exiled to Babylon. These events mark the end of
      the First Temple period.

    <h1 class="title Je"><u>Geography</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      Jerusalem is situated on the southern spur of a plateau in the Judaean
      Mountains, which include the Mount of Olives (East) and Mount Scopus
      (North East). The elevation of the Old City is approximately 760 m (2,490
      ft). The whole of Jerusalem is surrounded by valleys and dry riverbeds
      (wadis). The Kidron, Hinnom, and Tyropoeon Valleys intersect in an area
      just south of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley runs to the
      east of the Old City and separates the Mount of Olives from the city
      proper. Along the southern side of old Jerusalem is the Valley of Hinnom,
      a steep ravine associated in biblical eschatology with the concept of
      Gehenna or Hell.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      The Tyropoeon Valley commenced in the northwest near the Damascus Gate,
      ran south-southeasterly through the centre of the Old City down to the
      Pool of Siloam, and divided the lower part into two hills, the Temple
      Mount to the east, and the rest of the city to the west, the lower and the
      upper cities described by Josephus. Today, this valley is hidden by debris
      that has accumulated over the centuries. In biblical times, Jerusalem was
      surrounded by forests of almond, olive and pine trees. Over centuries of
      warfare and neglect, these forests were destroyed. Farmers in the
      Jerusalem region built stone terraces along the slopes to hold back the
      soil, a feature still very much in evidence in the Jerusalem landscape.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      Water supply has always been a major problem in Jerusalem, as attested to
      by the intricate network of ancient aqueducts, tunnels, pools and cisterns
      found in the city.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      erusalem is 60 km (37 mi) east of Tel Aviv and the Mediterranean Sea. On
      the opposite side of the city, approximately 35 km (22 mi) away, is the
      Dead Sea, the lowest body of water on Earth. Neighbouring cities and towns
      include Bethlehem and Beit Jala to the south, Abu Dis and Ma'ale Adumim to
      the east, Mevaseret Zion to the west, and Ramallah and Giv'at Ze'ev to the
      north.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Je">
      Mount Herzl, at the western side of the city near the Jerusalem Forest,
      serves as the national cemetery of Israel.
