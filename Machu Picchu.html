      Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern
      Cordillera of southern Peru on a 2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge.
      Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas", it is the most familiar
      icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within
      Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi)
      northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the
      Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain climate.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first
      encounter by the Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo, no Europeans are
      recorded to have visited the site from the late 16th century until the
      19th century. As far as historical knowledge extends, there are no
      existing written records detailing the site during its period of active
      use. The names of the buildings, their supposed uses, and their
      inhabitants, are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical
      evidence, including tombs at the site. Machu Picchu was built in the
      classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary
      structures are the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, and
      the Intihuatana. Most of the outlying buildings have been reconstructed in
      order to give visitors a better idea of how they originally appeared. By
      1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration
      continues. Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was
      constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438 to 1472).
      The Incas built the estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later,
      at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon
      dating, it was occupied from c. 1420 to 1532. Historical research
      published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu
      by the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the
      same name.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a
      UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. In 2007, Machu Picchu was voted one of
      the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="title Machu"><u>History</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Machu Picchu was previously believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of
      anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s. However,
      a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to
      reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530
      AD. Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec
      Inca Yupanqui (1438 to 1471) and TÃºpac Inca Yupanqui (1472 to 1493).
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      A consensus among archaeologists is that Pachacutec ordered the
      construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely
      after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered
      to be a "royal" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of
      succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned,
      seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca
      Empire. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox
      introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors even arrived in
      the area.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      During its use as an estate, it is estimated that about 750 people lived
      there, with most serving as support staff (yanaconas, yana) who lived
      there permanently. Though the estate belonged to Pachacutec, religious
      specialists and temporary specialized workers (mayocs) lived there as
      well, most likely for the ruler's well-being and enjoyment. During the
      harsher season, staffing was reduced to about one hundred servants and a
      few religious specialists focused on maintenance alone.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Studies show that, according to their skeletal remains, most people who
      lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the
      chemical markers and osteological markers they would have if they had been
      living there their entire lives. Instead, research into skeletal remains
      has found bone damage from various species of water parasites indigenous
      to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors
      and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long-term diets
      characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart. These diets are
      composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish,
      but the last-known short-term diet for these people was overall composed
      of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants
      were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a
      larger portion of food intake. Most skeletal remains found at the site had
      lower levels of arthritis and bone fractures than those found in most
      sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals who had arthritis and bone
      fractures were typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as
      the Mit'a) or served in the Inca military.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Animals are also suspected to have migrated to Machu Picchu, as there were
      several bones found that were not native to the area. Most animal bones
      found were from llamas and alpacas. These animals naturally live at
      altitudes of 4,000 meters (13,000 ft) rather than the 2,400 meters (7,900
      ft) elevation of Machu Picchu. Most likely, these animals were brought in
      from the Puna region for meat consumption and for their pelts. Guinea pigs
      were also found at the site in special tomb caves, suggesting that they
      were at least used for funerary rituals, as it was common throughout the
      Inca Empire to use them for sacrifices and meat. Six dogs were also
      recovered from the site. Due to their placements among the human remains,
      it is believed that they served as companions of the dead.

    <h1 class="title Machu"><u>Geography</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Machu Picchu lies in the Southern Hemisphere, 13.111 degrees south of the
      equator. It is 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, on the crest
      of the mountain Machu Picchu, located about 2,430 meters (7,970 feet)
      above mean sea level, over 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) lower than Cusco, which
      has an elevation of 3,400 meters (11,200 ft). As such, it had a milder
      climate than the Inca capital. It is one of the most important
      archaeological sites in South America, one of the most visited tourist
      attractions in Latin America and the most visited in Peru.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Machu Picchu features wet humid summers and dry frosty winters, with the
      majority of the annual rain falling from October through March.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Machu Picchu is situated above a bow of the Urubamba River, which
      surrounds the site on three sides, where cliffs drop vertically for 450
      meters (1,480 ft) to the river at their base. The area is subject to
      morning mists rising from the river. The location of the city was a
      military secret, and its deep precipices and steep mountains provided
      natural defenses. The Inca Bridge, an Inca grass rope bridge, across the
      Urubamba River in the Pongo de Mainique, provided a secret entrance for
      the Inca army. Another Inca bridge was built to the west of Machu Picchu,
      the tree-trunk bridge, at a location where a gap occurs in the cliff that
      measures 6 meters (20 ft).
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      The city sits in a saddle between the two mountains Machu Picchu and
      Huayna Picchu, with a commanding view down two valleys and a nearly
      impassable mountain at its back. It has a water supply from springs that
      cannot be blocked easily. The hillsides leading to it were terraced, to
      provide more farmland to grow crops and to steepen the slopes that
      invaders would have to ascend. The terraces reduced soil erosion and
      protected against landslides. Two high-altitude routes from Machu Picchu
      cross the mountains back to Cusco, one through the Sun Gate, and the other
      across the Inca bridge. Both could be blocked easily, should invaders
      approach along them.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Machu">
      Machu Picchu and other sites in the area are built over earthquake faults.
      This may not be a coincidence, according to 2019 research: "One simple
      answer, researchers now suggest, is that that's where building materials
      for the siteâlarge amounts of already fractured rockâwere readily
      available."
