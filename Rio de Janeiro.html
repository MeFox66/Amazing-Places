      Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the
      Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. In 1763,
      it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese
      Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil, Rio de
      Janeiro became the seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal. She
      subsequently, under the leadership of her son the prince regent John VI of
      Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United
      Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio remained as the capital of
      the pluricontinental monarchy until 1822, when the Brazilian War of
      Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the
      capital of a colonizing country officially shifted to a city in one of its
      colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the
      independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the
      capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred
      to Brasília.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and
      30th-largest in the world in 2008. This is estimated at R$343 billion. In
      the city are the headquarters of Brazilian oil, mining, and
      telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major
      corporations, Petrobras and Vale, and Latin America's largest telemedia
      conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes,
      it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil,
      accounting for 17 percent of national scientific output according to 2005
      data. Despite the high perception of crime, the city actually has a lower
      incidence of crime than most state capitals in Brazil.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern
      Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival, samba, bossa
      nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema,
      and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, landmarks include the giant statue
      of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven
      Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the
      Sambódromo (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which
      is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest
      football stadiums. Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics
      and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American
      and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the third time
      the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracanã Stadium
      held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA
      Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games. The city will host the
      G20 summit in 2024, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2027.

    <h1 class="title Rio"><u>History</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      Europeans first encountered Guanabara Bay on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de
      Janeiro, "January River"), during a Portuguese expedition under explorer
      Gaspar de Lemos, captain of a ship in Pedro Álvares Cabral's fleet, or
      under Gonçalo Coelho. Allegedly the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci
      participated as observer at the invitation of King Manuel I in the same
      expedition.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon
      Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French admiral
      Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort
      Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique
      colony. Eventually this French settlement became too much of a threat to
      the established Portuguese colony and in 1560 the order was made to get
      rid of them. A years-long military aggression was then initiated by the
      new Governor General of Brazil Mem De Sa, and later continued by his
      nephew Estacio De Sa. On 20 January 1567, a final defeat was imposed on
      the French forces and they were decisively expelled from Brazil for good.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      The city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded on 1 March 1565 by the
      Portuguese, led by Estácio de Sá, including Antônio de Mariz. It was named
      São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, in honor of St. Sebastian, the saint who
      was the namesake and patron of the Portuguese then-monarch Sebastião. Rio
      de Janeiro was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century,
      the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and
      buccaneers, such as Jean-François Duclerc and René Duguay-Trouin.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes
      discovered gold and diamonds in the neighboring captaincy of Minas Gerais,
      thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth
      (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, much
      farther northeast. On 27 January 1763, the colonial administration in
      Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city
      remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese
      royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from
      Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="title Rio"><u>Geography</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      Rio de Janeiro is near the west end of a strip (from Cabo Frio to just
      east of Ilha Grande) of Brazil's Atlantic coast close to the Tropic of
      Capricorn where the shoreline is oriented east and west; the city thus
      faces largely south. It was founded at the entrance to an inlet, Guanabara
      Bay (Baía de Guanabara), which is marked by a point of land called Sugar
      Loaf (Pão de Açúcar) a "calling card" of the city.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      The city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National
      Park, the world's first urban forest and UNESCO Environmental Heritage and
      Biosphere Reserve; Pedra Branca State Park, which houses the highest point
      of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the Quinta da Boa Vista
      complex; the Botanical Garden; Rio's Zoo; Parque Lage; and the Passeio
      Público, the first public park in the Americas. In addition the Flamengo
      Park is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the
      south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much
      vegetation.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      Since 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the
      largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest
      in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the
      world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is
      located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      Due to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region,
      the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The
      Guanabara Bay has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from
      domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters
      renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the
      tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers
      and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air
      are twice as high as that recommended by the World Health Organization, in
      part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by
      Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29
      million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers.
      With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high
      concentrations of heavy metals mainly zinc and cadmium have been dumped
      over the years by factories in the industrial districts of Santa Cruz,
      Itaguaí and Nova Iguaçu, constructed under the supervision of State
      policies.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      The Marapendi lagoon and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon have suffered with
      the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment
      buildings close by. The illegal discharge of sewage and the consequent
      deaths of algae diminished the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish
      mortality.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Rio">
      There are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made
      through a public-private partnership established in 2008 to ensure that
      the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The
      decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters
      present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and
      underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the
      daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the
      Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous
      concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.
