      The Giant's Causeway (Irish: Clochán an Aifir) is an area of about 40,000
      interlocking basalt columns, the result of an ancient volcanic fissure
      eruption. It is located in County Antrim on the north coast of Northern
      Ireland, about three miles (4.8 km) northeast of the town of Bushmills.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 and a national
      nature reserve by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland
      in 1987. In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, the Giant's Causeway was
      named the fourth-greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot
      and disappear under the sea. Most of the columns are hexagonal, although
      some have four, five, seven, or eight sides. The tallest are about 12
      metres (39 ft) high, and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres
      (92 ft) thick in places.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      Much of the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast World Heritage Site is
      owned and managed by the National Trust. It is one of the most popular
      tourist attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving over 998,000 visitors
      in 2019. Access to the Giant's Causeway is free of charge: it is not
      necessary to go via the visitor centre, which charges a fee. The remainder
      of the site is owned by the Crown Estate and several private landowners.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      Around 50 to 60 million years ago, during the Paleocene Epoch, Antrim was
      subject to intense volcanic activity, when highly fluid molten basalt
      intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive volcanic plateau. As the
      lava cooled, contraction occurred. Horizontal contraction fractured in a
      similar way to drying mud, with the cracks propagating down as the mass
      cooled, leaving pillarlike structures, which also fractured horizontally
      into "biscuits". In many cases, the horizontal fracture resulted in a
      bottom face that is convex, while the upper face of the lower segment is
      concave, producing what are called "ball and socket" joints. The size of
      the columns was primarily determined by the speed at which lava cooled.
      The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen
      today. The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called
      the Thulean Plateau, which formed during the Paleocene.

    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      In respect of its key role in the development of volcanology as a
      geoscience discipline, and notably the origin of basalt, the Palaeocene
      rocks of the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast were included by the
      International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100
      "geological heritage sites" around the world in a listing published in
      October 2022.

      The Bishop of Derry visited the site in 1692. The existence of the
      causeway was announced to the wider world the following year by the
      presentation of a paper to the Royal Society from Sir Richard Bulkeley, a
      fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. The Giant's Causeway received
      international attention when Dublin artist Susanna Drury made watercolour
      paintings of it in 1739; they won Drury the first award presented by the
      Royal Dublin Society in 1740 and were engraved in 1743. In 1765, an entry
      on the causeway appeared in volume 12 of the French Encyclopédie, which
      was informed by the engravings of Drury's work; the engraving of the "East
      Prospect" appeared in a 1768 volume of plates published for the
      Encyclopédie. In the caption to the plates, French geologist Nicolas
      Desmarest suggested, for the first time in print, that such structures
      were volcanic in origin.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      The site first became popular with tourists during the 19th century,
      particularly after the opening of the Giant's Causeway Tramway, and only
      after the National Trust took over its care in the 1960s were some of the
      vestiges of commercialism removed. Visitors can walk over the basalt
      columns that are at the edge of the sea, a half-mile walk from the
      entrance of the site.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      he causeway was without a permanent visitor centre between 2000 and 2012,
      as the previous building, built in 1986, burned down in 2000. While
      preliminary approval was given for a publicly funded (but privately
      managed) development by then Environment Minister and DUP member Arlene
      Foster in 2007, the public funding was frozen due to a perceived
      conflict-of-interest between the proposed private developer and the DUP.
      Ultimately, the private developer dropped a legal challenge to the
      publicly funded plan, and the new visitor centre was officially opened by
      2012. Its construction was funded by the National Trust, the Northern
      Ireland Tourist Board, the Heritage Lottery Fund and public donations.
      Since opening, the new visitor centre has garnered mixed reviews from
      those visiting the causeway, for its pricing, design, contents and
      placement across the causeway walk descent. In 2018, the visitor centre
      was visited by 1,011,473 people.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Gc">
      There was some controversy regarding the content of some exhibits in the
      visitor centre, which refer to the Young Earth Creationist view of the age
      of the Earth. While these inclusions were welcomed by the chairman of the
      Northern Irish evangelical group, the Caleb Foundation, the National Trust
      stated that the inclusions formed only a small part of the exhibition and
      that the Trust "fully supports the scientific explanation for the creation
      of the stones 60 million years ago." An online campaign to remove
      creationist material was launched in 2012, and following this, the Trust
      carried out a review and concluded that they should be amended to have the
      scientific explanation on the causeway's origin as their primary emphasis.
      Creationist explanations are still mentioned but presented as a
      traditional belief of some religious communities rather than a competing
      explanation for the causeway's origins.
