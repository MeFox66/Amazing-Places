      The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period, and over its
      history has been occupied at various times by Celtic tribes including the
      Picts and the Gaels, Scandinavian Vikings, and most notably the powerful
      integrated Norse-Gaels clans of MacLeod and MacDonald. The island was
      considered to be under Norwegian suzerainty until the 1266 Treaty of
      Perth, which transferred control over to Scotland.

      The main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Skye
      is part of the Highland Council local government area and wholly within
      the historic county of Inverness-shire. The island's largest settlement is
      Portree, which is also its capital, known for its picturesque harbour.
      Links to various nearby islands by ferry are available, and since 1995, to
      the mainland by a road bridge. The climate is mild, wet, and windy. The
      abundant wildlife includes the golden eagle, red deer, and Atlantic
      salmon. The local flora is dominated by heather moor, and nationally
      important invertebrate populations live on the surrounding sea bed. Skye
      has provided the locations for various novels and feature films and is
      celebrated in poetry and song.

    <h1 class="title Sky"><u>History</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Sky">
      A Mesolithic hunter-gatherer site dating to the seventh millennium BC at
      An Corran in Staffin is one of the oldest archaeological sites in
      Scotland. Its occupation is probably linked to that of the rock shelter at
      Sand, Applecross, on the mainland coast of Wester Ross, where tools made
      of a mudstone from An Corran have been found. Surveys of the area between
      the two shores of the Inner Sound and Sound of Raasay have revealed 33
      sites with potentially Mesolithic deposits. Finds of bloodstone microliths
      on the foreshore at Orbost on the west coast of the island near Dunvegan
      also suggest Mesolithic occupation. These tools probably originated from
      the nearby island of Rùm. Similarly, bloodstone from Rum, and baked
      mudstone, from the Staffin area, were found at the Mesolithic site of
      Camas Daraich, also from the seventh millennium BC, on the Point of Sleat,
      which has led archaeologists to believe that Mesolithic people on Skye
      would travel fairly significant distances, at least 70 km, both by land
      and sea.

      Rubha an Dùnain, an uninhabited peninsula to the south of the Cuillin, has
      a variety of archaeological sites dating from the Neolithic onwards. A
      second- or third-millennium BC chambered cairn, an Iron Age promontory
      fort, and the remains of another prehistoric settlement dating from the
      Bronze Age are nearby. Loch na h-Airde on the peninsula is linked to the
      sea by an artificial "Viking" canal that may date from the later period of
      Norse settlement. Dun Ringill is a ruined Iron Age hill fort on the
      Strathaird Peninsula, which was further fortified in the Middle Ages and
      may have become the seat of Clan MacKinnon.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Sky">
      The late Iron Age inhabitants of the northern and western Hebrides were
      probably Pictish, although the historical record is sparse. Three Pictish
      symbol stones have been found on Skye and a fourth on Raasay. More is
      known of the kingdom of Dál Riata to the south; Adomnán's life of Columba,
      written shortly before 697, portrays the saint visiting Skye (where he
      baptised a pagan leader using an interpreter) and Adomnán himself is
      thought to have been familiar with the island.[62] The Irish annals record
      several events on Skye in the later seventh and early eighth centuries
      mainly concerning the struggles between rival dynasties that formed the
      background to the Old Irish language romance Scéla Cano meic Gartnáin.

      Legendary hero Cú Chulainn is said to have trained on the Isle of Skye

      The Norse held sway throughout the Hebrides from the 9th century until
      after the Treaty of Perth in 1266. However, apart from placenames, little
      remains of their presence on Skye in the written or archaeological record.
      Apart from the name "Skye" itself, all pre-Norse placenames seem to have
      been obliterated by the Scandinavian settlers. Viking heritage, with
      Celtic heritage is claimed by Clan MacLeod. Norse tradition is celebrated
      in the winter fire festival at Dunvegan, during which a replica Viking
      longboat is set alight.

    <h1 class="title Sky"><u>Geography</u></h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Sky">
      At 1,656 km 2 (639 sq mi), Skye is the second-largest island in Scotland
      after Lewis and Harris. The coastline of Skye is a series of peninsulas
      and bays radiating out from a centre dominated by the Cuillin hills
      (Gaelic: An Cuiltheann). Malcolm Slesser suggested that its shape "sticks
      out of the west coast of northern Scotland like a lobster's claw ready to
      snap at the fishbone of Harris and Lewis" and W. H. Murray, commenting on
      its irregular coastline, stated, "Skye is 60 miles [100 km] long, but what
      might be its breadth is beyond the ingenuity of man to state". Martin
      Martin, a native of the island, reported on it at length in a 1703
      publication.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Sky">
      The Black Cuillin, which are mainly composed of basalt and gabbro, include
      12 Munros and provide some of the most dramatic and challenging mountain
      terrain in Scotland. The ascent of Sgùrr a' Ghreadaidh is one of the
      longest rock climbs in Britain and the Inaccessible Pinnacle is the only
      peak in Scotland that requires technical climbing skills to reach the
      summit. Nearby Sgùrr Alasdair, meanwhile, is the tallest mountain on any
      Scottish island. These hills make demands of the hill walker that exceed
      any others found in Scotland and a full traverse of the Cuillin ridge may
      take 15 to 20 hours. The Red Hills (Gaelic: Am Binnean Dearg) to the east
      are also known as the Red Cuillin. They are mainly composed of granite
      that has weathered into more rounded hills with many long scree slopes on
      their flanks. The highest point of these hills is Glamaig, one of only two
      Corbetts on Skye.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Sky">
      The northern peninsula of Trotternish is underlain by basalt, which
      provides relatively rich soils and a variety of unusual rock features. The
      Kilt Rock is named after the columnar structure of the 105-metre (344 ft)
      cliffs, said to resemble the pleats in a kilt. The Quiraing is a
      spectacular series of rock pinnacles on the eastern side of the main spine
      of the peninsula and further south is the rock pillar of the Old Man of
      Storr. The view of the Quiraing and the Old Man of Storr is one of the
      most iconic in all of Scotland and is frequently used on calendars and
      tourism guides and brochures.
    </h1>
    <h1 class="sub_text paragrth_start Sky">
      Beyond Loch Snizort to the west of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula,
      which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish peninsula is
      separated from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of
      Isay. It is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 296 metres (971 feet) on the
      west at Waterstein Head and on the northwest at Biod an Athair where, a
      metre from the summit trig pillar, the cliffs drop 1,029 feet (314 metres)
      to the ocean. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley.
      Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish
      and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen
      Brittle and whose beaches are formed from black basaltic sands. Strathaird
      is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few
      crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of
      Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and
      boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered
      eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of
      Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye
      and the mainland.
